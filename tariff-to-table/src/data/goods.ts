// Commonly-used goods that India taxes relatively heavily on import.
//
// TARIFF RATES are approximate but real: each reflects India's actual import
// duty (basic customs duty, or the effective duty where cesses matter), sourced
// in `source` below. They are verified against official Budget / CBIC / PIB
// figures as of 2025 and labelled "approximate" in the UI because policy shifts.
//
// Goods are modelled by their *natural unit*:
//   - 'recurring'  → a household's typical spend PER YEAR (oil, clothes, etc.)
//   - 'durable'    → the price of ONE item bought occasionally (phone, TV)
//
// `amount` (yearly spend or one-item price, in ₹, per tier) and `importShare`
// are realistic MODELLED estimates, not exact survey values. Each amount is set
// as a plausible share of that tier's yearly household budget, grounded in the
// Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES 2022-23) and real per-capita
// consumption (e.g. India uses ~19.7 kg of edible oil per person per year, so a
// ~5-person lower-income household spending ₹7,800/yr on oil ≈ 4% of a ₹18k/mo
// budget). Richer households spend more in rupees but a SMALLER share of income
// on essentials (Engel's law) — which is why a tariff acts like a regressive tax.
// The "How these figures are estimated" panel on the Simulator page explains this.

export type Tier = 'low' | 'middle' | 'high'

// How the ₹ amount for each income tier was worked out, shown on the page so
// every figure is traceable. `note` frames the method; low/middle/high give the
